Absolutely — here’s a **beginner-friendly README-style guide** that focuses on **what the tool does**, **why it matters**, and **how to use it**, without diving into code or technical dependencies.

# 📊 RAG-Based Policy Report Evaluator  
*A tool for checking if a policy summary matches its official source documents*

---

## 🧭 Executive Summary

This tool helps **policy analysts, researchers, and government reviewers** answer a simple but critical question:

> **“Is this report accurate—and properly grounded in the official documents it claims to describe?”**

It does this by:
- Breaking your report into small chunks,
- Automatically finding the most relevant passages in the official source documents,
- Using AI to **score each chunk for accuracy (0–10)**,
- Providing **clear explanations** and **direct quotes** from the source as evidence.

The result? A **color-coded Excel file** that shows exactly where your report is strong—and where it might be misinformed, misattributed, or based on the wrong jurisdiction (e.g., confusing England’s curriculum with Wales’).

No technical expertise needed—just your report PDF and the right source documents.

---

## 🎯 Why Use This?

- ✅ **Catch factual errors** before publishing.
- ✅ **Verify attribution**—ensure every claim ties back to an official source.
- ✅ **Detect jurisdictional mix-ups** (e.g., citing England policy when discussing Wales).
- ✅ **Save time**—automate what would take hours of manual cross-checking.
- ✅ **Produce audit-ready reports** with full traceability (page numbers included!).

Ideal for:
- Civil servants reviewing draft policy briefs  
- Researchers validating literature reviews  
- NGOs checking government claims  
- Academic teams auditing curriculum documents

## 🔁 How It Works (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Documents
You need **two things**:
1. **Your report** (PDF): The document you want to evaluate (e.g., *“Curriculum for Wales – Summary”*).
2. **Official source documents** (PDFs): The authoritative materials your report should be based on (e.g., *England’s National Curriculum* or *Wales’ Statutory Guidance*).

> 💡 These source documents must already be processed into a **RAG index** (we’ll explain how your team can do this once).

---

### Step 2: Run the Evaluation
1. Launch the tool.
2. When prompted:
   - Enter the **name of your source index** (e.g., `England` or `Wales`).
   - Enter the **full file path** to your report PDF.
3. Wait a few minutes while the tool:
   - Reads your report,
   - Compares each section to the official sources,
   - Scores and explains every part.

---

### Step 3: Review the Results
You’ll get an **Excel file** with:
- A **color-coded score** for each chunk (🔴 red = inaccurate, 🟢 green = accurate),
- A **helpful comment** explaining why the score was given,
- **Direct quotes** from the source documents (with page numbers!) as evidence.

At the bottom, you’ll see an **overall average accuracy score**—a quick snapshot of your report’s reliability.

---

## 🛠️ Behind the Scenes (For the Curious)

This tool uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**—a smart combination of:
- **Semantic search**: Finds the most relevant official passages for each claim.
- **AI fact-checking**: Asks a language model to judge accuracy—but **only using the retrieved evidence**, so it can’t make things up.

All decisions are **grounded, traceable, and transparent**.

---

## 📌 Important Notes
- **Garbage in, garbage out**: If your source documents don’t match your report’s topic (e.g., using England docs to check a Wales report), the tool will correctly flag everything as inaccurate.
- **Always review the evidence**: The AI provides suggestions, but human judgment is essential.
- **This is not magic**—it’s a **decision-support tool** to make your review process faster and more rigorous.

## 🚀 Ready to Get Started?

Contact your technical team to:
1. Build a RAG index from your official source PDFs (one-time setup).
2. Run the evaluator on your draft reports.

You’ll get back a clear, actionable, and fully auditable assessment—every time.

Absolutely! Here’s a **clear, beginner-friendly, step-by-step breakdown of your RAG evaluation pipeline**, written for non-technical users (e.g., policy analysts, researchers, or reviewers). It explains **what happens at each stage** and **why it matters**, without referencing code or technical packages.

---

## 🔁 Step-by-Step: How the Evaluation Pipeline Works

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Documents**
- **You provide**:  
  - A **draft report** (PDF) you want to check (e.g., *“Summary of England’s National Curriculum”*).  
  - A **set of official source documents** (PDFs) that your report should be based on (e.g., DfE policy papers, curriculum statutes).  

> 💡 These source documents must already be processed into a **searchable knowledge base** (called a “RAG index”) by your technical team. This is a one-time setup.

---

### **Step 2: Break the Report into Small Chunks**
The tool splits your report into **short, manageable passages** (about 1–3 sentences each).  
- Each chunk keeps its **original page number** for traceability.  
- Overlapping is used to avoid cutting off ideas mid-sentence.

> ✅ **Why?** It’s easier to fact-check one idea at a time than an entire page.

---

### **Step 3: Find the Most Relevant Source Passages**
For each report chunk, the system:  
- Searches the official source documents,  
- Finds the **3 most relevant excerpts** (with page numbers),  
- Uses **semantic understanding** (not just keyword matching) to find meaning-based matches.

> ✅ **Why?** This ensures the AI only uses **truly relevant evidence**—not random quotes.

---

### **Step 4: AI-Powered Fact-Checking**
The AI (Gemini) is given:  
- The **report chunk**,  
- The **3 retrieved source excerpts**,  
- Clear instructions: *“Score accuracy from 0–10. Cite evidence. Explain your reasoning.”*

It returns:  
1. **Accuracy Score** (0–10):  
   - **10** = perfectly accurate and fully supported  
   - **0** = completely wrong or based on the wrong source (e.g., Wales vs. England)  
2. **Helpful Comment**:  
   - Explains *why* the score was given  
   - Notes missing words, misattributions, or jurisdictional errors  
3. **Evidence Used**:  
   - Direct quotes from the source, **with page numbers**

> ✅ **Why?** Every judgment is **transparent, grounded, and auditable**.

---

### **Step 5: Compile Results into a Review-Ready Excel File**
All evaluations are combined into a single spreadsheet with:  
- One row per report chunk,  
- Color-coded scores (**red → green**),  
- Auto-wrapped text for readability,  
- An **overall average accuracy score** at the bottom.

> ✅ **Why?** You can instantly see:  
> - Which parts are strong (🟢),  
> - Which need revision (🔴),  
> - Exactly what to fix and where the evidence is.

---

### **Step 6: Human Review & Action**
You (the expert) use the Excel file to:  
- **Verify** the AI’s judgments,  
- **Revise** inaccurate or unsupported claims,  
- **Strengthen attribution** using the cited page numbers,  
- **Confirm** whether a low score is due to a real error—or a mismatched source (e.g., using England docs to check a Wales report).

> ✅ **Why?** The tool doesn’t replace you—it **supercharges your expertise** with speed and precision.

---

## 🔄 Real-World Example from Your Output
- **Report Chunk**: *“England Curriculum Framework… preparing them for opportunities, responsibilities…”*  
- **AI Response**:  
  - **Score**: 9/10  
  - **Comment**: *“Missing final word ‘life’—should be ‘later life.’”*  
  - **Evidence**: *“[Page 5] …prepares pupils… for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life.”*  

→ You fix one word, and the claim is now perfect.

This pipeline turns **hours of manual cross-checking** into a **10-minute automated review**—with full transparency and zero hallucination.
